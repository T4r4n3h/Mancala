# MANCALA
Mancala is an African originated game which is played by 2 players. The game is performed on a Mancal Board which has  6 pits  and 1 Mancala( score pit) per player. There are 48 peices of marble that are distributed evenly in each players cup 9 4 per pit). 
The objective of each player is to collect as many marbles in their mancal as possible. below is a picture of a more traditional game board:
