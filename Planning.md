### State 3 - Finishing the Game and Counting the Score
1. The Game ends when All the Pits of either Player is emplty.
2. The Player with the rmaining Marbles will take all the Marbles from their Pits and place them into its Mangala

## Planning The Game
### 1. Analyse the app's functionality
* As a (player), I want to see a board with the pits and the amount of stones in each pit in order to visualize my state of the game and how the pits are filling up or emtying out in order to strategize my move better. 

### 2. Think about the overall design (look and feel of the app)
* Here I choose the theme of the app 
    * maybe choose a music option to play in the background 
    * the style of design I have in mind for the app would go here 
### 3. Wireframe the UI
* this will have a blueprint for the HTML & CSS.
* also reveal the apps data(state)and functionality

### 4. Pseudocode
* lets outline the app's logic in a plain informal way.

### 5. Analyze the app's state (data)
* what does the app need to "remember" throughout its execution
* Use the wireframe, the user stories and pseudocode to help determne what state to track
* if your app has a database, this is where it is analyzed

### 6. Set up the Project
* create the files 
    * html
    * css
    * js
### 7. Create a local repo

### 8. Adding comments and try to organize the app
/*----- constants -----*/  
/*----- app's state (variables) -----*/  
/*----- cached element references -----*/  
/*----- event listeners -----*/  
/*----- functions -----*/  

### 9. Code away!


### 10.Some recomendation for more interactive browser app's
* Create a main {render function }
