1. lets go ahead and call are vairables in APP state in this case are gonna be the following 
    *playerA and 
    *playerB
    *board
    *playerTurn
3. identify our cashed elements 
    3.1 restart button
    3.2 

2. declare a init-funciton to set our board to its initialized setting 
  and create player A as the person who makes the first move 

the board is an array where MancalaA is board[6] and MancalaB is board[13]

board = [ 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]

4. dynamic rendering ??
  4.1 create the board and the div's within the board ( see if you can make coordinates for the pits.

  4.2 create init funtion to create the board

  4.3 add event listener to the board to respond upon 'click';
    4.3.1 create the event listener to ONLY respond when it is one of the pits of the 'current playerTurn' and 
    4.3.2 only if it is the pits and NOT the mancalas
    4.
