1. lets go ahead and call are vairables in APP state in this case are gonna be the following 
    *playerA = 1 and 
    *playerB = -1

    *board
    *playerTurn
3. identify our cashed elements 
    3.1 restart button
    3.2 board pits

2. declare a init-funciton to set our board to its initialized setting 
  and create player A as the person who makes the first move 

the board is an array where MancalaA is board[6] and MancalaB is board[13]
 
board = [ 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4 , 4 , 4 , 0]
index =   0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,13] 
length of this array is 14
4. dynamic rendering ??
  4.1 create the board and the div's within the board ( see if you can make coordinates for the pits.

  4.2 create init funtion to create the board

  4.3 add event listener to the board to respond upon 'click';
    4.3.1 create the event listener to ONLY respond when it is one of the pits of the 'current playerTurn' and 
    4.3.2 only if it is the pits and NOT the mancalas ()
    4

5. create an id for each pit to correspond with the array index.

6. for the event listener add a funciton to distribute the marbles. while the #marbles > 0 increment the pits[pitIdx] by one and decrement the # marbles

    6.1 change the flow of the game with if statements 
     
     6.1.1 if the player is player A and the pitInx >13 continue to pitIndex  #0 again and continue; 

      6.1.2 if the plaer is player B and the pitIdx is NOT 13 continue

  7. change a p to show the number of marbles in the pit this is temporary and will change in the future
